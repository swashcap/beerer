  "description": "We took our unfiltered, unfettered, unprecedented Palo Santo Marron aged in handmade wooden brewing vessels and aged it in it in not one, but two kinds of wood!\n\nFirst, it spends a month aging in our 10,000-gallon Palo Santo tanks made from South American 'holy wood,' which provides layers of caramel and sandalwood. Then, it spends four more months in bourbon barrels for notes of oaky vanilla and coconut.\n\nBourbon Barrel-Aged Palo Santo is a draft offering that will also be making an appearance in a limited edition bottle release on June 16 at our Milton brewery!",

From the Juice yeast emerges an ethereal realm with suspended ambient fruit and lupulin resonance. Aromatic and resinous, the primal essence of Modern Times, Holy Mountain, and Fort George rises like a Monolithâ€¦.no, make that a Triolith of IPA reverence. 3-Way IPA, reverbating across the Pacific Northwest starting June 2018.",
